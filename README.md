 Sugra Games is an online videogame marketplace where game developers can sell their video games directly to customers. The website has been designed to provide unique functionality and UI/UX features to game developers and gamers; upon signing up to the website, users choose whether they're buying and selling games, and are given access to unique features based on their  profile usertype. Developers can submit games to be included on the website's store; games must first be authenticated by the site administrator before being published and made available on the public marketplace. Gamers can buy games, and then leave reviews and comments and games which they've purchased. Gamers also can view their download library, wishlist and previous orders. 
 
 Furthermore, users can sign up very easily through their gmail accounts - this makes the sign up process very streamlined, thereby providing value to users and getting them registered on the website as quick as possible. 
 
 The name is derived from the Irish word *s√∫gradh*, which relates to the concept of play. The logo is a simple representation of a video game controller, using a bright and playful colour palette that sets the visual aesthetic of the entire site. 

## UX

The primary goal of this project, from a User Experience (UX) perspective, was to deliver two distinct yet visually cohesive user interfaces - one designed specifically for developers, and the other tailored for gamers. These two interfaces, though catering to related but separate audiences, were intended to work in harmony, drawing from the same underlying database and complementing each other seamlessly.

The app's design prioritizes simplicity and intuitiveness, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interaction. Key user actions are reinforced through the use of strategically placed pop-up messages, providing immediate feedback and confirmation to the users. This approach aims to create a sense of clarity and control, guiding users through the app's functionality in a natural and intuitive manner.

The unified aesthetic across the developer and gamer interfaces serves to reinforce the app's brand identity and create a cohesive user experience, even as the specific functionality and features cater to the distinct needs of each target audience. This design approach not only enhances the overall user satisfaction but also fosters a sense of familiarity and trust. 

By carefully balancing the unique requirements of developers and gamers while maintaining a visually harmonious and responsive user experience, this project aims to deliver a compelling and engaging application that meets the diverse needs of its users.

### Colour Scheme

This color palette comprises a mix of bold, vibrant colors like auburn and green, creating an eye-catching and dynamic aesthetic that grabs users' attention, all while visually referencing the bright, "plastic" aesthetic of old video game consoles such as the SNES, Mega Drive and Gameboy. The inclusion of softer tones like the champagne pink and white smoke offers balance, preventing the design from feeling overly intense or fatiguing for users browsing the site for extended periods. These calmer hues are effectively used for layout elements, typography, and backgrounds, ensuring a pleasant and comfortable viewing experience.

Furthermore, the overall harmony of the palette creates a cohesive brand identity that is applied consistently across the website, from the landing pages to individual product listings. This coherence helps reinforce the professionalism and trustworthiness of the marketplace, crucial factors for convincing users to engage with and purchase from the platform. 
The versatility of the color choices also allows for easy implementation across different user interface components, from navigation menus to call-to-action buttons.

By leveraging this thoughtfully curated color palette, the website can establish a visually striking and user-friendly design, ultimately enhancing the overall experience for both casual browsers, dedicated gamers, and professional game developers looking to sell their creations.

### Typography

Four different fonts are used across the website. 

[Oxanium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxanium) is used for the logo banner and headings. it has a subtly futuristic, technological style that coheres with the video game theme of the site. 

[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) is used for sub-headings. It is a neutral, sans-serif font that is accessible in terms of reading legibility. 

[Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans) is used for the primary informational text throughout the site. Like Roboto, it is a readable sans serif font.  

[Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) is used for call-to-action buttons. This font is more explicitly linked to video game aesthetics, and is used throughout the website to highlight areas of user interactivity; this reinforces the website's link to video games.  

Social media brand icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) are used in the footer.

## Business Model

- **Type**: Business-to-Consumer relationship with customers (B2C) and Business-to-Business relationship with developers (B2B)
- **Offerings**: Sugra is a marketplace dedicated to providing a wide range of video games. 
- **Audience**: The audience is twofold:
  - Gamers of all ages, from casual to hardcore players, with a focus on providing a user-friendly shopping experience.
  - Developers who want to sell their games
- **Sales Process**: Sugra offers one-off payment for customers to download games.
- **Key Objectives**: Build a strong, trusted brand in the gaming industry through high-quality offerings, reliable customer service, and a seamless online shopping experience.

### Growth Strategy
- **Local to Global**: Initially focus on domestic growth by partnering with local game developers, then gradually expand to international markets.
- **Customer Feedback**: Use initial customer feedback to refine product offerings and prioritize popular game genres.

## SEO & Marketing Strategy

### SEO Strategy
1. **Keyword Research**
   - Conduct comprehensive keyword research using tools like SEMrush and Google Trends to identify short-tail keywords (e.g., "video games marketplace," "buy video games online") and long-tail keywords (e.g., "best place to buy indie games online," "exclusive video game deals").


2. **On-Page SEO**
   - Optimize meta tags, titles, descriptions, and URLs with relevant keywords.
   - Use descriptive file names and alt text for images to increase search relevance.

   Implementation examples:
   - Meta description and keywords implemented in base.html for site-wide SEO
   - Keywords focused on indie gaming marketplace and developer-centric terms
   - Alt text used consistently for game thumbnails and screenshots
   - Descriptive URLs using game titles and developer names
   - Structured data for game pricing, ratings, and reviews
   - Mobile-responsive design for better search engine rankings

3. **Technical SEO**
   - Implement a clean sitemap and `robots.txt` file to facilitate proper indexing by search engines.
   - Optimize for speed by compressing images and using pagination to ensure a fast, responsive user experience.
   
   Implementation examples:
   - Pagination implemented for game listings and reviews
   - Image optimization through Cloudinary
   - Responsive image loading using Bootstrap classes
   - Clean URL structure throughout the application
   - Fast loading times through efficient database queries


### Marketing Strategy

For this project, I created a simple wireframe of a Facebook Business Page, as seen below. 

![Facebook Business Page](documentation/facebook-wireframe/facebook-wireframe.png)

I have also added a MailChimp link in the footer. This is a means of encouraging users to sign up for the Sugra Newsletter, which would provide a direct means of communication between the product owner and the two target audiences. 

Below I set out future steps that would be taken to market the website and company more broadly:

1. **Social Media Marketing**
   - Establish and maintain active pages on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to share game updates, community engagement posts, and exclusive deals.
   - Feature user-generated content and testimonials to build trust and community presence.
   - Use targeted advertising, including in-game ads on popular platforms, to reach a gaming-focused audience.

2. **Email Marketing**
   - Build a newsletter to share updates, new game releases, and special promotions. Offer incentives like exclusive discounts to encourage sign-ups.
   - Use Mailchimp to segment email lists and send tailored promotions based on user preferences and past purchases.

3. **Influencer Marketing**
   - Partner with popular gaming influencers and streamers to promote Sugra on platforms like Twitch and YouTube.
   - Offer affiliate links or discount codes to encourage influencers' audiences to make purchases.

4. **Community Engagement**
   - Sponsor or participate in local gaming events and conventions to foster brand awareness and build relationships with potential customers.
   - Consider sponsoring eSports tournaments or collaborating with popular game developers for exclusive content on the Sugra platform.

5. **Paid Advertising**
   - Utilize Google Ads and Facebook Ads to reach potential customers by targeting relevant keywords and demographics.
   - Employ retargeting ads to reach users who visited Sugra but haven‚Äôt yet made a purchase, increasing conversion opportunities.

The success of the above strategies would be ascertained through monitoring and assessing of the following performance metrics. 

- **SEO Success**: Track organic search traffic, keyword ranking improvements, and click-through rates.
- **Social Media Engagement**: Monitor engagement rates, follower growth, and conversions from social media channels.
- **Email Campaign Performance**: Track open rates, click-through rates, and conversions from email marketing efforts.
- **Sales and Revenue Growth**: Measure revenue growth, average order value, and customer acquisition costs to determine the effectiveness of marketing strategies.

By implementing these SEO and marketing strategies, Sugra could establish a strong, recognizable presence in the video game marketplace sector, effectively reaching its target audience and driving sustained growth.

## Database Design

At the outset of the project, I made an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to help visualize the database architecture before creating my models.

While I did ultimately simplify certain aspects of the models, this ERD provided a good foundation before coding the actual models in my project.

![draw.io erd](documentation/erd/sugra-erd.drawio.png)

The ERD as included below reflects the finalised database architecture of the website.

## Agile Development Process

Throughout the project, I prioritised the development and implementation of Agile methodologies as a means to efficiently prioritise and manage my workload. 

Initially, I commited to a central Theme for the website. From that, I derived Epics, each handling a particular area. I further broke down each Epic into several User Stories. 

![Theme, Epics and User Stories](documentation/agile/agile-methodology.drawio.png)

With the broad overview of the project broken down, I then used [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cthlbrennan/sugra/issues) as an Agile methodology tool. There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage User Stories, giving each of them Acceptance Criteria and User Tasks, as per best practice. 

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/cthlbrennan/sugra/projects) also served as an Agile tool; While it isn't a specialized tool, I was able to easily adapt it to be used as the basis for weekly iteration boards, as well as a tool for documenting the Product Backlog. Through Github Projects, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis.

At the conclusion of the project, each User Story has been closed.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories for every iteration*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://sugra-d21ca322fc38.herokuapp.com/).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `‚åò+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cthlbrennan/sugra) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/cthlbrennan/sugra.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/cthlbrennan/sugra)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cthlbrennan/sugra)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

To my knowledge, there are no differences between the local and deployed versions of the website.
